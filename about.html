          <p>
            In August of 1990, the Lord told me these words, 'Raise me a
            Supernatural army'. I have been running with those words ever since.
            I started a Christian fellowship on campus in Ile-Ife Nigeria while
            I was a student there. After graduation, I started a church in
            Lagos, Nigeria. In 1999, the Lord asked me to move to the United
            States of America. I started a church in Chicago, Illinois in 2002.
            These 3 churches have grown to produce many other churches all over
            Africa, Europe and North America. They are the KingsWord Churches. I
            am called to be an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. I delight in
            church planting and traveling the world to preach the Gospel.

            The KingsWord Churches all over the world are my heart. I have a
            responsibility to plant strong, vibrant churches all over the world.
            By the Grace of God, we have already done this to an extent. We have
            churches in North America, Europe and Africa. Through these
            churches, people are being discipled. They are discovering God's
            purpose for their lives and they are getting equipped to go after
            that purpose.

          <h3>My Apostolic Work</h3>
          <h6>My responsibility to the Body of Christ</h6>
          <p>
            I feel a deep responsibility towards the body of Christ. I believe
            this is connected to my calling as an apostle. The word apostle
            means 'sent one'. I am sent to preach the Word with the
            demonstration of God's power all over the world. That is why I
            travel to different nations to preach and teach God's Word. I travel
            to Asia, Africa, Europe and different cities in North America;
            preaching the gospel. It brings me great joy to see people get a
            revelation of God's Word and rise up out of their darkness to
            embrace the freedom that comes from the truth of the Word of God. I
            also love to see people healed in their bodies. It is truly a
            demonstration of God's Word.

          <p>
            My most important call is to be a husband and a father. Without the
            support of my family, I couldn't do what I do. I am blessed with a
            great wife and two wonderful children. I love them with all my heart
            and I am committed to them. They bring me so much joy. I can not say
            enough about their contribution to my life and ministry. My wife's
            name is Mayowa, people call her Pastor May. My son's name is Tolu,
            he calls himself Kayson. My daughter's name is Temi. She simply goes
            by Temi for now.
