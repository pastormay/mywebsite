                I convene annual Women's Conferences in North America( Chicago),
                Europe( London) and Africa( Lagos). They are a time for women to
                get together in fellowship and to hear an encouraging word for
                the year. I usually invite awesome speakers to join me in
                ministering at these conferences. We explore a theme each year.
                The theme is a prophetic word for the year and it conveys a
                powerful message from God for that season of our lives. The
                women usually leave more encouraged, more motivated and more
                energized than before. To find out the conference dates for this
                year, visit www.kingswordwomen.org.

                Every December, I have a Refresh, Recharge and Refocus retreat
                for women. The retreat is in Chicagoland at an exclusive resort
                just outside the city. The purpose of the retreat is to give
                women an opportunity to relax and recharge from the curret year
                in preparation for the next one. Women come from different
                cities of the United States and Canada to attend these retreats.
                They enjoy good food, good fellowship and a great tim ein God's
                Word. We have opportuntities to share testimonies and intimate
                details about our lives that we maynot be able to at other times
                during the year. On the Saturday night of the retreat, we have
                the Pajamas Praise Party. This is always a favorite for the
                attendees. We just let our hair down, dance and have a great
                time. The retreat is a registered event. Registration opens in
                March. For more information, visit www.kingswordwomen.org.

                coming up with strategies that connect our present day to where
                we see KingsWord in the future. In simple terms, I try to make

                I like to encourage Pastor's wives and discuss issues that are
                important to us. It can be a lonely walk sometimes. The people
                you see most often may not understand you. Your world may seem
                small. You may go through things that make you feel alone. 'Dear
                Pastor's Wife' started as a monthly recording that I put up on
                facebook and YouTube. It is now chaging to become a monthly
                podcast. Watch out for it and subscribe to hear nuggets on being
                a Pastor's wife or just to laugh at some of my stories.

                I have a vision to decorate the KingsWord Apostolic Place in a
                way that reminds us of our calling to the world and our
                commitment to that call. Although, other than putting up a few
                maps of the world, I haven't yet done much with this vision, I
                plan to do much more as the days get much warmer. I hope to put
                subtle reminders all over the facility. They will not be
                obnoxious but will be a pleasant way of staying focused on our
                calling.
