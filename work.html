                SummerBlast is a conference that is very dear to my heart. I
                host it in Chicago every year. It is a meeting where my Pastor,
                Reverend Victor Adeyemi, and his Pastor, Reverend George
                Adegboye, have the liberty to minister to people extensively. I
                also minister at this conference but I sit to get ministered to
                for the most part. SummerBlast is an 8-day conference starting
                from Sunday and ending the following Sunday. There is a
                Minister's Conference on Monday and Tuesday. Saturday is a day
                for Music and Healing. SummerBlast is the annual convention for
                KingsWord North America. People travel from all over the United
                States, Canada and other countries to attend SummerBlast.
                KingsWord pastors and members come from Africa, Europe and other
                parts of North America. It is always an exciting time.

                The Supernatural Conference or Supernatural Campmeeting is an
                annual event that I hold in Lagos, Nigeria. The conference lasts
                for 8 days with meetings in the morning and evening on most of
                the days. People come from all over Nigeria to attend the
                conference. Members of KingsWord Churches from all over the
                country as well as our partners gather together for this
                impactful conference. If you want an extended time in God's
                presence that guarantees change, this is the meeting for you.
                Real change takes time and we give God all the time He needs to
                bring the change He wants. I usually have other ministers join
                me throughout the week to minister at these meetings. Come for
                an encounter with God.

                Every year I hold the GRACE Culture meeting on the first Monday
                in October in Lagos, Nigeria. The vision for Grace Culture is to
                disciple believers in the realities of God's Grace. When Grace
                becomes a culture then believers will have no problems making it
                a lifestyle. We have been called by grace, saved by grace and
                brought into God's kingdom to live by grace. It takes time to
                adopt a culture. That is why these meetings are extended times
                in God's Word. A Grace Culture meeting typically starts at
                10:00am and ends at 5:00pm. Each season, people leave with fresh
                revelation about the Grace of God. I usually have at least one
                other teacher of the Word who is well-versed in the subject of
                Grace join me for the teachings.

                SNOW is an acronym for 'Supernatural Night of Wonders.' I host
                SNOW meetings at the different KingsWord Churches all over the
                world. They are meetings marked with revelatory teaching of
                God's Word followed by signs and wonders. I am always amazed at
                the miracles God does at these meetings. I regularly hold SNOW
                meetings all over North America, U.K. and Nigeria. I hope you
                can make plans to join us at one of these SNOW meetings sometime
                soon. You will have an experience with God that you wont soon
                forget.

                Every weekday morning( Monday to Friday), I lead a prayer
                conference with all our members and partners all over the world.
                There is no better way to start your day than by prayer. I
                believe in individual prayer but I also believe there is power
                when we come together to pray. You can usually connect to this
                prayer session on my social media pages and also through the
                KingsWord App. We pray for 15 minutes from 7:00am - 7:15am CST.
                It is short and powerful and a great way to start your day.

                When I am not traveling, you can usually catch me preaching at
                The KingsWord Apostolic Center in Chicago. We are located in a
                beautiful cathedral that was built in 1905. I preach there on
                Friday nights and Sunday mornings. I really enjoy my time with
                my Chicago family. They are the best congregation one could ask
                for. I am not the resident pastor of the church but that is the
                base for my Apostolic ministry. The church was founded in 2002
                when my wife and I moved from California to Chicago based on
                God's direction. From a group of 6 people in a basement, it has
                grown to become a church in a beautiful facility and a place
                that many people call home.
