          <p>
            Isaiah 41:10 "Fear not, for I am with you; Be not dismayed, for I am
            your God. I will strengthen you, Yes, I will help you, I will uphold
            you with my righteous right hand."
          </p>

          <p>
            Many times, we lack courage because we forget that God is with us.
            Courage means the quality of mind or spirit that enables a person to
            face difficulty or pain without fear. It also means bravery. For
            instance, I am working on losing 20 pounds. Aside from when I lost
            weight after having my two children, I have never had to lose this
            much weight before. The pounds just sort of crept up on me( rather
            quickly too). I gained about 15 of those pounds in the space of two
            months. So, it is a bit intimidating setting out to lose that
            weight.
          </p>

          <p>
            Courage however means bravery. The quality of mind or spirit that
            enables me to face the challenge. For a believer however, it goes
            beyond that. For me as a believer, it means facing a challenge
            because God is with me. He will strengthen me through the journey.
            He will help me. When I feel like quiting, He will do something on
            my inside that will infuse me with fresh energy. He will help me. To
            help means that I am not doing this alone. When I feel alone and the
            going seems tough, all I need to do is stop looking at myself. I
            could do that by worshipping God. By acknowledging Him in my
            peculiar circumstances. I could also do that by looking up to Him
            for help through the things I need to do that I may not feel like
            doing. I am not alone. I have a help in God. I should take courage
            because of that knowledge.
