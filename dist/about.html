            I am a Software Engineer turned Pastor. Well, maybe it's better put
            this way; I am a Pastor who dabbled into Software Engineering for a
            bit and is now an interesting amalgamation of both. I got my
            Bachelor's from Uniersity of Oklahoma, Norman Oklahoma and my
            Master's from Cornell University, Ithaca New York. For many years, I
            travelled the US and Canada for my business as a Business
            Intelligence Consultant. At the end of 2017, I closed shop on that
            aspect of my life and moved squarely into the work of ministry. I
            love organizing women's conferences which I do every year in
            Chicago, London and Lagos. I am a minister at KingsWord
            International Church - Chicago. My 9 to 5 is as Executive Vive
            President of KingsWord Everywhere where I map out strategy for
            growth in all our activities as a ministry.

            I have two lovely children. They are growing so fast. They are not
            so little anymore. My first born is Tolu. he calls himself Kayson(
            his daddy is Kay for short. So, 'Kayson'. Kay's son. Get it?). He is
            currently in residential high school and comes home most weekends.
            My daughter's name is Temi( we are still looking for a good nickname
            for her because 'MayDaughter' doesn't sound cute). She is all kinds
            of creative. She is into so many things and good at most of them. I
            am married to Dr Kay Ijisesan. He used to be Pastor Kay but he
            changed his name when he started traveling so much. That is what an
            Apostle does. You can hop on over to his page to find out more about
            him.

          <p>
            A teacher's job is to describe things in a simple way so people get
            it. My job is done when people see the light. I am a teacher by
            calling. I try to use practical, everyday examples to drive my
            message home. I love teaching God's Word. I teach at the KingsWord
            Women's Conferences in Chicago, London and Lagos every year. That
            means I travel to Europe and Africa on an annual basis. I have also
            taught in The Philippines, Asia. I hope to start a regular women's
            meeting in Asia soon. That is a big vision for me. I teach at my
            local church, KingsWord International Church, Chicago when my
            husband is traveling. I travel to other KingsWord churches to teach
            as well.

          <h3>Career Resources</h3>
          <h6>Heavenly Resources for the Workplace</h6>
          <p>
            Several years ago, I wrote a book titled, 'Wisdom for the
            Workplace'. In the book, I put down different things that the Lord
            hah showed me over the years about how believers can excel in the
            Marketplace. I worked in the secular arena for about 18 years. In
            that space of time, I worked as an employee and as a business owner.
            I travelled extensively and worked with people all over the United
            States and Canada. I had the opportunity to observe a lot of things
            in the workplace. I also got the opportunity to see how God's Word
            can be applied at the workplace to make sure a believe functions
            optimally in that world. I love to share these tips in career
            meetings and conferences. I have not done a lot of them recently but
            those are meetings I hope to organize more of in the future.
