            <p>Four fundamental temperaments have been identified in people. They are;</p>
            <p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Sanguine</span> personality type is described primarily as being highly talkative, enthusiastic, active, and social. Sanguines tend to be more extroverted and enjoy being part of a crowd; they find that being social, outgoing, and charismatic is easy to accomplish.</p>
            <p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Choleric</span> individuals tend to be more extroverted. They are described as independent, decisive, goal-oriented, and ambitious. These combined with their dominant, result-oriented outlook make them natural leaders.</p>
            <p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Melancholic</span> individuals tend to be analytical and detail-oriented, and they are deep thinkers and feelers. They are introverted and try to avoid being singled out in a crowd. A melancholic personality leads to self-reliant individuals who are thoughtful, reserved, and often anxious.</p>
            <p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Phlegmatic</span> individuals tend to be relaxed, peaceful, quiet, and easy-going. They are sympathetic and care about others, yet they try to hide their emotions. Phlegmatic individuals are also good at generalising ideas or problems to the world and making compromises.</p> <p><figcaption class="figcaption">“Four Temperaments.” Wikipedia, Wikimedia Foundation, 9 June 2020, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_temperaments.</figcaption></p></div>

            Temperaments have strengths and weaknesses. Sanguines are a lot of fun. They make friends easily and are great to be with. But sanguines can hurt people with their words. They don't always exercise caution when they speak.</p>

            <p>You see, it's not just you. All temperaments have strengths and weaknesses. Melancholics are thoughtful and analytical but have you seen a melancholic get depressed? It's not pretty. I love that cholerics are goal-oriented and great leaders. But they can also be insensitive, bossy, and over-bearing. Phlegmatics get along with almost everybody. They are easy-going. They however have problems with procrastination. Every temperament has weaknesses and those weaknesses affect relationships.</p>

            <p>We want others to see the world the way we see it. We wander why people don't 'get' us. Have you ever been in a relationship where you wondered why he just didn't 'get' you? Well, it may just have been because you have different personality types or temperaments. You can make this work for you and not against you.</p>

        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">A Personality Change</span><p><span class="headline hl2">But I am Born-Again...</span></p></div>There is nothing wrong with you! Just like every other Christian, you just need to let the process of change that God's Word initiates enhance your strengths and reduce your weaknesses. No, you don't change automatically because you got saved. Your spirit changed but your soul, where your personality seats, has to go through a process of renewal.</p>

            <p>Your personality is part of your soul. Anything that affects your soul affects your personality. <span class="citation">"Receive... the engrafted Word, which is able to save your souls."</span> But I am born-again! You may say. Why do I need to do all these? God took care of your spirit but you have work to do in the soul-arena. James 1:21 and Romans 12:2 are great scriptures that tell us about this.</p>
            <p><span style="font-style: italic;">"...But be transformed by the renewing of your mind..." Romans 12:2.</span></p></div>
        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl3">Ben and Alice</span><p><span class="headline hl4">Opposites Attract</span></p></div><p>Ben is primarily phlegmatic and secondarily melancholic. Alice is equally choleric and sanguine. When they first met, the chemistry was palpable. Alice loved Ben for his calmness and patience. Ben loved Alice because she had a drive which he lacked, but admired. Now, they are 6 months into a relationship that they believed was from God but they can't stand each other. Alice cannot believe how long it takes Ben to make every single decision. Ben is sick and tired of Alice's bossyness. They both want out! They see no way foward.</p><p>What do you think?
