Isaiah 41:10 "Fear not, for I am with you; Be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, Yes, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."

Many times, we lack courage because we forget that God is with us. Courage means the quality of mind or spirit that enables a person to face difficulty or pain without fear. It also means bravery. For instance, I am working on losing 20 pounds. Aside from when I lost weight after having my two children, I have never had to lose this much weight before. The pounds just sort of crept up on me( rather quickly too). I gained about 15 of those pounds in the space of two months. So, it is a bit intimidating setting out to lose that weight.

Courage however means bravery. The quality of mind or spirit that enables me to face the challenge. For a believer however, it goes beyond that. For me as a believer, it means facing a challenge because God is with me. He will strengthen me through the journey. He will help me. When I feel like quiting, He will do something on my inside that will infuse me with fresh energy. He will help me. To help means that I am not doing this alone. When I feel alone and the going seems tough, all I need to do is stop looking at myself. I could do that by worshipping God. By acknowledging Him in my peculiar circumstances. I could also do that by looking up to Him for help through the things I need to do that I may not feel like doing. I am not alone. I have a help in God. I should take courage because of that knowledge.
